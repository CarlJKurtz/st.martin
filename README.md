# St. Martin
![Specimen of St. Martin Medium](documentation/specimens/StMartin-Spectacles.png)
St. Martin highlights a typographic artifact found in the works of the 19th-century Parisian printer Jean-Alexis Rouchon and applies it to a sans-serif base. In the accompanying essay, [*St. Martin, the Stencil Type that Wasn’t*](https://carljkurtz.de/pages/stmartin/index.html), I speculate on the possible origins of the defining feature of the design.

St. Martin was created in 2024 by Carl J. Kurtz for the class Ghostly Presences at the HAW Hamburg, in which the students examined the works of the 19th-century Parisian printer Jean-Alexis Rouchon.
